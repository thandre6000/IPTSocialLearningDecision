Also, it was much easier to differentiate a picture where the skin color was very different from the others. It's much harder to keep track of multiple people who don't have many characteristics I can point out easily. Some of the words I used were a bit silly, like how one of the people reminded me of a rapper, so I would repeat in my mind ""rapper, keep"" if I saw him with the word ""keep"" under him.

Some of the faces that popped up on spontaneous reflection were instantly untrustworthy; it was most likely due to subconscious physical factors I immediately noticed such as the expression on their face, whether they seemed open or closed off, and whether their eyes were squinting in distrust or not. These influenced my decisions to rate them as trustworthy or untrustworthy and also influenced how much money I was willing to give them or not give them based on what I thought their feedback would be. I definitely used first impressions as a standard in this task.","Yes, I developed very quick and simple but easily memorable tricks to identify the same people as I went along the task. These included saying out loud identifiable hair colors, physical marks such as eyebrow slits, differing shades of skin color, and other characteristics like if they had a hat on or ear piercings which made it easier to track who was who and who did what along the many tasks.","I did notice personally that along the same gradient of one task, the same people would vary their styles at different points. For example, during the game where you had to choose to give the other person 1-5 points, it was quadrupled, and they could choose how many points they wanted to give back to you if any. Out of the same 3 people during one iteration of the task, one person would continuously give half the points back and then suddenly switch up their strategy and not give you any points, while another person would start doing the opposite and start giving you points when they hadn't previously. This was not a perfect or exact pattern but followed loosely along those lines, and so I used it to my advantage by giving a person all 5 points and then after a while not giving them any the first time they didn't share back with me. This worked decently well so I think I interpreted the pattern correctly.

","It's difficult for me to remember how people's looks are associated with different things, because I can't trust anyone but those that are closest to me and have proven their loyalty. I know that a man that smiles does not mean he can be trusted, same as the man who does not smile. They are all the same creature with different muscles being activated on the face. My only trick is, having learned from the top psychologists and richest men on Earth, is trust no one. Men specifically ,especially with all this child pedophilia going on, have proven time and time again that the Stanely Prison Experiment holds true. They will pick evil given the right circumstances. Humans are also imperfect, inconsistent creatures that CANNOT be trusted simply by ONE LOOK. ","I just noticed people were inconsistent. Some were giving then not, almost at random. All I realized is that regardless of what you look like, you're inconsistent. Humans need to stop coming to conclusions about others based on their looks. This narrative is flawed. We need to begin to trust people based on their resume, as in, their character and what their experiences are like stoicism dictates. With assuming that a man's appearance means he may or may not be trustworthy, come consequences. There's no scientific basis. ",5,"No real strategy. I trust no one period. I need to see what kind of people they are over a long period of time to even conclude anything.
